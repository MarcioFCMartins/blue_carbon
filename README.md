# blue_carbon

The blue_carbon repository is a collection of functions/codes/various with the main focus to help "blue carbon" scientists


At the moment, the following functions are presented:
-  *bc_comp*
- 


## *bc_comp*

*bc_comp* compute the **Percentage of core compression** and the correspondent **Linear Correction Factor** using three arguments 

`bc_comp(tube_lenght, core_in, core_out)`

#### Arguments

- `tube_length` lenght in cm of the sampler,
- `core_in` lenght in cm of the part of the sampler left outside of the sediment (from the inside of the sampler),
- `core_out`lenght in cm of the part of the sampler left outside of the sediment (from the outside of the sampler)


Every suggestions/comments/changes to improve all the codes are welcome :)
